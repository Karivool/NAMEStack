NAMEStack is a simple app built in the MEAN stack to get experience building with said technologies. The app itself is a stat spreadsheet where you can add, delete, and edit entries.

Created with:
* Node.js
* AngularJS
* MongoDB
* Express

## Features

* Add, edit, and delete entries like a pro! Add Card will let you add in a card after putting in stats, Edit will let you edit an entry then put in the new info with the Update button, while Delete will let you remove undesirable cards like a pro.
* Amazing up-to-date technology means editing entries allows the page to re-render with the newly added/deleted entry without having to hit that pesky Refresh button on your browser or some combination of the F5 key! A powerful refresh() method written in JavaScript will make you think you feel like internet royalty!
* Snazzy CSS pops out at you with eye-dazzling colors and formatting, giving the UI a sleek, modern look that ensures you feel with it with fellow kids.

## Future Considerations

* More dynamic stat editing maybe?
* Hotter CSS?
* More stats that can be put in or changing what stats you want?
* More features, maybe each card can get a picture?
* Angular 2 instead of Angular 1.x?
* Midi music with over 8 instruments streamed directly from your speakers?
